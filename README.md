## About

**n8n × web** is a collection of custom nodes built for n8n, the popular open-source no-code workflow automation tool.

While n8n is fantastic for automating tasks without needing to code, it doesn’t currently support blockchain integrations.

That’s where we come in! Our project adds seamless web3 functionalities, making it easy for anyone to interact with various blockchain protocols right within n8n.

## Capabilities

With **n8n × web3**, no-code developers can effortlessly add blockchain features to their workflows. Plus, pro web3 developers can quickly prototype their decentralized apps and blockchain solutions without the hassle. Our custom nodes handle common blockchain tasks like:

- Converting data between JavaScript and Solidity
- Signing data with ECDSA
- Sending raw transactions via JSON RPC
- Automatically generating transaction data from Smart Contract ABIs
- Using standard Smart Contract ABIs without any coding
- Listening for blockchain events to trigger workflows

## Looking ahead

Down the road, we’d love to expand even more—think support for non-EVM blockchains like Bitcoin, Solana, and Flow, or adding tools for working directly with Solidity and managing ZK proofs. Eventually, we aim to have these nodes integrated into n8n’s core, joining the existing ~200 web2 service nodes and making blockchain automation a breeze for everyone.
