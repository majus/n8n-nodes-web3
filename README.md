## Looking ahead

Down the road, we’d love to expand even more—think support for non-EVM blockchains like Bitcoin, Solana, and Flow, or adding tools for working directly with Solidity and managing ZK proofs. Eventually, we aim to have these nodes integrated into n8n’s core, joining the existing ~200 web2 service nodes and making blockchain automation a breeze for everyone.
